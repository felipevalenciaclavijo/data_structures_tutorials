# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial. Data structures are fundamental to programming. Here are the 3 data structures you are going to be studying:

* [Queues](/1-queues.md)
* [Sets](/2-sets.md)
* [Trees](/3-trees.md)

Each module will contain descriptions, explanations, and walkthroughs in Python with real-world situations examples, and at the end, you'll have a problem to solve using the data structure. Unsolved files, as well as solution files, are provided too. You should only review the solution after you have worked enough time trying to solve the problem by yourself without success.
